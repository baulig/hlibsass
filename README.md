hLibsass is a low-level binding to [LibSass](https://github.com/sass/libsass "LibSass"). It provides basic types used by the library along with a FFI interface to the C API.

This is really a low-level library, if you want a high-level, more Haskell-friendly library, check out [hSass](https://github.com/jakubfijalkowski/hsass).

It is available on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlibsass).

### Documentation

This library is (mostly) 1-1 binding to LibSass. See [LibSass wiki](https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki "LibSass wiki") for documentation.

### Static, shared or external version of LibSass?

hLibsass supports three different ways of linking with Libsass:

1. Static, locally-built LibSass,
2. Shared, locally-built LibSass, requires setting `sharedLibsass` flag,
3. External (e.g. system package), requires setting `externalLibsass` flag.

The first two options rely on the LibSass being distributed with the `hlibsass` package and compiled during configure/build process. hLibsass is always distributed with LibSass version that is compatibile with the package.

Up until version `0.1.6.0`, the first option was preferred, because LibSass has been distributed as a source package only. Development package of LibSass is now available in most Linux distributions and in Homebrew, so using it is equally good option

Using locally-built **shared** version of LibSass may require adjusting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or putting `libsass.so` somewhere in the `PATH`, so this option is discouraged. However, if you really want to use it that way, you may use [tools/libpath.sh](tools/libpath.sh) to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (it extracts the library location using `ghc-pkg`).

`externalLibsass` flag has precedence over `sharedLibsass`.

### hLibsass and LibSass version

hLibsass uses LibSass internally and therefore is quite tightly bound to LibSass. Every breaking change in LibSass C API will break hLibSass (either at compile-time or at runtime, depends on the change). For now, these combinations should work:

- hLibsass 0.1.5.x with LibSass 3.3.2 (distributed with) and 3.4.3 (not every function is reexported, but there were no changes that would break hLibSass),
- hLibsass 0.1.6.x with LibSass 3.4.3 (distributed with),
- hLibsass 0.1.7.x with LibSass 3.5.2 (distributed with)
- hLibsass 0.1.8.x with LibSass 3.5.5 (distributed with),
- hLibsass 0.1.9.x with LibSass 3.6.3 (distributed with),
- hLibsass 0.1.10.x with LibSass 3.6.3 & 3.6.4 (distributed with),
- LibSass 3.5.x **WILL** have breaking changes and will result in runtime failures of hLibSass versions prior to 0.1.7.0 (and probably compile-time failures too), see [LibSass releases page](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases) for more details.

### Building on Windows

hLibsass by default builds LibSass as part of it's build process. This means that it will require C & C++ compiler. On Linux that is not a problem most of the time since Clang/GCC is (almost) available on bare systems. On Windows it requires a little bit of additional packages.

The minimum that hLibsass requires is [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/). Installing it and compilig hLibsass using it's shell (so that `PATH` is configured correctly) should be enough to get started.

Up until hLibsass 0.1.10, hLibsass required also `env` binary. It is distributed as part of [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)/[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). The easiest way to use that is to use Stack. It [installs MSYS2](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/developing_on_windows/) as part of their setup and compiles your packages inside POSIX-compatibile shell. You can follow instructrions on [Stack documentation](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/developing_on_windows/#cmake) on how to install MinGW-w64 there. 

### Things to consider

Libsass is C++ library with C API, so in order to use it, it is necessary to provide C++ runtime. This library is linked against `libstdc++` (Windows & Linux)/`libc++` (macOS) automatically, so you don't have to deal with linking process.

### Known limitations

#### GHCi not able to load hLibSass

GHC 7 is unable to load static version of native libraries (at least some of them) and therefore it rejects loading `libsass.a`. On Linux, you can overcome this by switch to GHC 8 (tested with 8.0.2 with LTS Haskell 8.5) or by using shared or external (also shared) version of LibSass. On macOS, GHC 8 still rejects the library (it detects unresolver/duplicated symbols), so the only solution is to use shared/external LibSass (Homebrew version works).
